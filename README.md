In this project, we analyzed and predicted customer churn for a telecom company. Churn refers to the rate at which customers discontinue their services. The dataset contained 5000 entries with 21 features, including service usage metrics, customer plans, and churn indicator. We cleaned the data by dropping irrelevant columns and handling missing values. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand data distributions and correlations. We created new features and encoded categorical variables. A Random Forest Classifier was used to predict churn. The model was evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. The results indicated that the model performs well, with an accuracy of over 85%. Based on the performance, recommendations were made to further improve the model and reduce churn. This analysis helps telecom companies to understand churn and develop strategies to retain customers and enhance profitability.
